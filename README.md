## Why we made it
The recent California wildfires left countless lives uprooted and reduced entire neighbourhoods to ash. Despite the destruction, we were inspired by the resilience of the people affected. Many lost everything they worked hard to build, yet people still found strength within each other, and within their communities.

That's why we created **Resilient**â€”a community-driven platform built to keep people informed, connected, and supported during natural disasters.

## How it works
At its core, **Resilient** ensures critical information reaches those who need it most, and it does this by empowering users to report incidents. By specifying a location, the incident is marked on a map for easy identification of unsafe areas.

To ensure accuracy, users can *agree* or *disagree* with reports, and by factoring in... 
- the user's **proximity** to the incident
- the **time** since the report was created
- and the **number** of users who agreed

...our algorithm will ensure that only **verified** information is shared.

All verified reports are added to a knowledge base which drives our **Voiceflow**-powered voice agent. Users can call the agent and ask questions like...
- *"Am I safe at ___?"*
- *"What's the status of the fire at ___?"*
- or *"Should I evacuate?"* 

The voice agent then provides curated responses and suggests the next steps, ensuring users receive **accurate** and **timely** advice when they need it most!

## The goal
Our goal with **Resilient** was to leverage the community to share critical information **faster** and more **accurately** than traditional news sources, contributing to a safer, more connected world where no one feels alone in the face of disaster.

## Looking forward
We believe that **Resilient** has the potential to be more than just a hackathon project, and so my team and I have decided to continue development in the hopes of  launching a fully-fledged platform in the coming months.
